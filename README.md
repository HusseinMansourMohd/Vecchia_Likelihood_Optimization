# Vecchia_Likelihood_Optimization

## Introduction

The `Vecchia_Likelihood_Optimization` repository offers an R-based solution for parameter estimation using the Vecchia likelihood. This method is pivotal in spatial statistics and Gaussian processes, where the covariance structure is integral to the analysis.

The Vecchia likelihood is a popular approximation method in spatial statistics, especially when dealing with large datasets. It provides a computationally efficient way to estimate parameters without having to invert large covariance matrices. This repository provides a comprehensive implementation to simulate data, define the necessary functions, and optimize the parameters using this likelihood.
